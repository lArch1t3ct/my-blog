Stavros started his careers as a L1 SOC analyst engaging tasks like:
* Threat hunting,
* Monitoring cybersecurity alerts,
* Adhering to SLAs,
* Contacting OSINT investigation, when needed
* Training the newcoming analysts

After completing a year as an analyst, the opportunity to assume the role of Senior Cybersecurity researcher was emerged which he grabbed it by its horns. Assuming this role, Stavros engaged in projects like:
* Developing WAF signatures to tackle web application attacks and 
* Threat intelligence research by monitoring the cybersecurity landspace of key market verticals and conducting OSINT investigations to produce actionable threat intelligence.

Moving forward to his career journey, his next role was that of a Penetration Tester. He engaged in various projects such as:
* Web Application & API Pentesting
* Thick Client Pentesting
* Physical Pentesting
* External Perimeter & Vulnerability Scanning
* Threat Intelligence-based scenario composition for iCast & Tiber engagements
* Tool Development

Stavros after an almost 5-year career in cybersecurity, he realized that he is more energetic about building things rather than pointing finger to weaknesses. After all, the need to build things is embedded in the human DNA. Thus, he decided to pursue a career in web development as a front-end engineer.
